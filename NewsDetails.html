    <h2>1. India-China relations: Modi's hope for a thaw amid uncertain geopolitics</h2>

    <p>In a recent interview, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke positively about India's relationship with long-time
        rival China. He said normalcy had returned to the disputed India-China border and called for stronger ties.These
        are striking comments, because tensions have been high since a nasty border clash in the northern Ladakh region
        in 2020 - the deadliest since a 1962 war. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning expressed appreciation
        for Modi's words and declared that "the two countries should be partners that contribute to each other's
        success". Modi's pitch for closer partnership isn't actually as big of a leap as it may seem, given recent
        improvements in bilateral ties. But the relationship remains strained, and much will need to fall into place -
        bilaterally and more broadly geopolitically - for it to enjoy a true rapprochement. India-China ties have many
        bright spots.</p>

    <h2>2. Ukraine upbeat and Russia in no rush at truce talks in Saudi Arabia</h2>

    <p>US negotiators have held talks in the Saudi capital Riyadh with their Ukrainian counterparts and are separately
        meeting the Russians. Washington's aim is to bring about an immediate partial ceasefire to the war in Ukraine,
        followed by a comprehensive peace deal. So could these Riyadh talks produce the breakthrough so many are hoping
        for? It depends who you listen to. Yet Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman has dampened expectations. "We are
        only at the beginning of this path," he told Russian state TV. Kyiv suffered one of its heaviest attacks from
        Russian drones on Saturday night, with three people killed, including a five-year-old girl. The Kremlin,
        meanwhile, seems to be in no rush to sign up to a ceasefire, with Vladimir Putin adding on numerous "nuances",
        or preconditions, before agreeing to the 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington and agreed to by Kyiv.</p>
